		<br><hr><br>
		<p><strong>Scott Cao:</strong></p>
		<p>Hey what are your guys’ takes on the south China seas debate?</p>
		<p>I’m trying to learn more about the issue</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p><strong>Paul Sy:</strong></p>
		<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines_v._China" target="_blank">Philippines v. China - Wikipedia</a></p>
		<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_disputes_in_the_South_China_Sea" target="_blank">Territorial disputes in the South China Sea - Wikipedia</a></p>
		<p>in any case, keep it up, and you'll have more US military bases in the region soon. heck, i wouldn't be surprised if vietnam gets one.</p>
		<p>i know you guys don't like containment, but chinese military bases in the SCS is a good way for politicians to justify containment.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p><strong>Brock Sun:</strong></p>
		<p>After World War II, there was no legal consensus surrounding the South China Sea dispute. </p>
		<p>The United States never incorporated it into Philippine territory. The French (via Indo-China) also never formally incorporated them. The Spratly Islands were basically a no-man's land. </p>
		<p>After World War II ended, the geopolitical significance of scattered islands and reefs was fully realized after the Pacific War. </p>
		<p>The first party to hop on the post-war sea claims was none other than Chiang Kai Shek. Under him, the ROC map was redrawn to include an 11-dash line encompassing all unsettled islands and reefs in the sea. An expedition was also sent in 1947 to establish a permanent ROC presence on the largest island in the Spratly's – Taiping Island – and Taiwan still occupies it to this day. </p>
		<p>The Philippines was also decolonized in 1946. It was not immediately official, but Philippine leaders long pushed for the Spratly's to be de jure incorporated. After a long time, expeditions would eventually be funded and a claim line drawn up. Obviously, the majority of the islands and reefs are closer to Philippine territory than to Vietnam or China. But despite this geographic advantage, the Philippines was basically a brand new nation-state which is problematic in its own way. </p>
		<p>The PRC inherited the ROC's 11 Dash Line. It was later reduced to the 9 dash line we see today after Vietnam and China agreed on a maritime boundary near Hainan. </p>
		<p>Then Vietnam's position is complicated as hell. Ho Chi Minh basically ceded Vietnamese claims to the PRC. When South Vietnamese troops occupied the Paracel Islands, the PLA kicked them out and the North Viets recognized it as Chinese territory. The islands were a bit of an afterthought for North Vietnam which didn't even have a navy. The rest of the South China Sea was basically an American lake during the entirety of the Vietnam War, with American ships ferrying supplies and personnel back and forth between Vietnam and the Philippines. </p>
		<p>Skip to 1979: China has a security pact with Cambodia, but Cambodian troops keep raiding southern Vietnam. Vietnam protests to China about the Cambodian incursions, but China is unable to get Pol Pot to get his shit together. Vietnam launches an all out invasion of Cambodia to depose the Khmer Rouge. China has a mutual defense treaty with Cambodia, so China launches a punitive invasion into North Vietnam and desolates the countryside. The Soviet Union does nothing to help Vietnam (the Soviet Union had a mutual defense treaty with Vietnam), and basically let the Chinese invasion just happen. Vietnam claims it won the war because China retreated instead of sieging Hanoi. However, Vietnam was humiliated by the war because the Soviet Union failed the stop China, and to make matters worse, was now in a prolonged conflict with Cambodia and economically isolated from the rest of the world right when China began the Reform and Opening. </p>
		<p>This brief 1979 war with China caused Vietnam to crackdown on all ethnic Hoa (Chinese-Vietnamese) people and to de-recognize Chinese claims in the South China Sea that they had previously recognized. Before the 1980s, Vietnamese maps still used the Sinocentric term "Nam Hai" for the sea (meaning "South Sea"), but after the 1980s all Vietnamese maps and textbooks must call it "Dong Hai" or East Sea (the name they also previously used for the East China Sea which they called Hoa Dong Hai thereafter). Vietnam also raced to get their armed fishermen to establish a presence in the Spratly's, which resulted in clashes throughout the 1980s.</p>
		<p>Vietnam and the PRC re-established diplomatic relations in 1991 and would settle their land border in 1999 in a deal that involved Vietnam ceding a strip of land to China. This didn't sit well with Vietnamese nationalists who still felt the humiliation of the 1980s when China ransacked the north, ASEAN formed a trading bloc without them, and the Soviets abandoned them. </p>
		<p>To appease the nationalists, the Vietnamese government continued to delay settling the maritime dispute. They used their warming relations with China as a distraction so that they could establish a permanent military and civilian precense in the Spratly's. They ended up occupying more islands than the Philippines. China under Hu Jintao kind of turned a blind eye to the Vietnamese expansion because they wanted to prioritize good relations. </p>
		<p>If you look at a map of occupied islands and reefs, it is full of Vietnam. If look into land reclaimation, Vietnam also did a ton of it during that time. The Philippines in comparison did very little. </p>
		<p>Of course, also during the 2000s, China was slowly building up and modernizing it's navy while making diplomacy with the world. </p>
		<p>The turning point came in 2011 when Obama's foreign policy shifted from the Middle East and toward the Asia Pacific. This is when Hillary went on her tours to every Asian country. This is also when Obama famously visited Vietnam. </p>
		<p>The US military policy also saw a turning point in 2011, when it was announced that the military would shift away from countering terrorist insurgencies and back toward countering conventional enemies. Obviously, this meant China and Russia. </p>
		<p>The Pivot to Asia and the reshuffling of US military resources obviously spooked China, which had to take some assertive measures with it's new economic and military might. </p>
		<p>That is in part how Xi Jinping rose to power. He promised to the CCP elite that he would stabilize the maturing economy, fix some of the problems resulting from rapid development (like massive corruption, brain drain, and capital outflow), and find a way to manage US hegemony (Belt and Road, military modernization) as well as respond to Vietnam's expansion (time for islands). </p>
		<p>In relation to the islands, the ones occupied by the PRC were too small to establish a permanent presence --- and much too small to counter the sheer quantity of islands Vietnam occupied. So they did the insane and reclaimed land in the middle of nowhere. And just like that, they asserted themselves. </p>
		<p>The gun was never really pointed at the Philippines which really doesn't feel threatened by China in the way Vietnam does (or else PH would have done the same long ago). It's pointed at Vietnam which specifically wants to expand as much as possible, and had been doing so under China's nose for a decade. </p>
		<p>Of course, the news headlines are just about "China China China" despite the fact that Vietnam had been expanding like crazy for a long time already. </p>
		<p>But Paul is now dragging an arbitrary tribunal into this that has no binding power. The ruling merely states that China has no historical claim over the islands, BUT the ruling does not affirm the Philippines has any legitimate claim either. </p>
		<p>This is where subjective international law comes into play. According to the Law of the Sea, only "islands" can be considered as territory to define territorial waters and have an Exclusive Economic Zone. It further defines an island as a feature that is permanently above water and can sustain natural freshwater. </p>
		<p>In the entirety of the Spratly islands, only ONE island fits into this definition. It is Taiping Island which was occupied by the ROC in 1947. It is the largest island and the only one naturally containing a fresh water table. </p>
		<p>However, Western countries completely ignore this fact despite it qualifying under international law. </p>
		<p>The reason is simple: recognizing Taiwan's administration over the island since before the ROC moved to Taipei would mean that the SCS dispute would just become a conflict between China and Taiwan. By legitimizing the Taiwanese claim, the Chinese claim is also validated.</p>
		<p>Just some food for thought. </p>
		<p>Furthermore, the US will try to contain China regardless of whether China militarizes a few reefs or not. </p>
		<p>If the United States really cared about "international law", they'd be doing Freedom of Navigation patrols against Vietnam's several military installations in the Spratly's... which according the US logic, are also illegal. </p>
		<p>However, I will agree on one thing. Out of everyone, the Philippines is not an aggressor. They had every chance to aggressively expand like Vietnam and later China, but didn't.</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p><strong>Scott Cao:</strong></p>
		<p>Excellent explanations 👍</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p><strong>Brock Sun:</strong></p>
		<p>I could even argue that in the 1980-90s, Philippines even had every reason to expand and nothing to lose from it. </p>
		<p>On the other side was Vietnam which PH was still on bad terms with, and a refugee crisis started because Vietnamese and other refugee boat people flooded into the Philippines. </p>
		<p>There was also a ton of arms and drug smuggling via the South China Sea between Thailand/Vietnam/Cambodia and Philippines. </p>
		<p>Philippines would have had the full backing of the United States if they occupied the islands then and asserted their claim. Vietnam had zero leverage, and China also didn't yet have much. They'd risk nothing. </p>
		<p>But didn't. </p>
		<p>And they ended up losing. The US won't support PH because it also means opposing Vietnam, the best ally of convenience against China. As well as Taiwan that has Taiping and the legal argument on their side. </p>
		<p>Duterte is also well aware that the United States is prioritizing Vietnam and letting Vietnam getting away with so much. How can Duterte go to war with China over the Spratlys when China occupies a handful of islands and Vietnam has over 20? It's nonsensical. </p>
		<p>If the US was principled, they'd kick China AND Vietnam out of the Spratlys --- then recognize Philippine claims over it. </p>
		<p>But this would only result in Vietnam realigning with China. </p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p><strong>Li Kai-Cong:</strong></p>
		<p>In a nut shell, my take on the South China is that it's the South China Sea. It's exactly that with certain powers trying to change Chinese territorial integrity.  China has legitimate historical based claims drawn in the 9 dotted lines (11 dots for ROC) and back it up with historical records of it's past tiem adminstration. Other countries don't have a strong claim but still want to have a shot at it. Chinese terroritorial claims had always been there from the earliest maps dating back to as far as few thousand years, a few centuries on western maps at least. Nobody ever challenged it. </p>
		<p>China pressence's Sea pressence faded in recent century especially during the times of colonial powers, War with Japan, decline of the Qing empire, ROC was still trying to piece things back together, which led to many others moving in especially western powers since they became a maritime power. World War created a bigger gap, since WWII there were many issues with restoring territories to their former status (especially betwen China and Japan) many things were left out and you can safely say the mess is largely created by western powers. </p>
		<p>China's fault was being a weaker maritime power not fighting off colonial powers to  maintain a strong pressence in this area. So that created a perception of a "free unoccupied space". </p>
		<p>It is only in recent events  (since U.S strategic move into Asian pacific) that has fanned the flames and disputes erupting tensions among all ASEAN, not just China but between all ASEAN countries. The narrative concerning China in the SCS is a geopolitical strategy that underscores U.S-China influence in this region. </p>
		<p>IMO China and ASEAN would actually be ok without intervention or even escalating if U.S stays out and let things resolve itself. Thats what it's mostly about. </p>
		<p>But due to geopolitics, western powers would like to have all Asian nations align themselves with U.S to challenge China. </p>
		<p>China's beef is mostly with U.S military presence more than it has to do with ASEAN. </p>
		<p>In the case of Taiwan and Mainland China, Both are China, they don't really contest with each other unless Taiwan party want to claim independence then it cannot just inherit Chinese territories. </p>
		<p>Situation seems to have changed now, Asia is more focused on economic prosperity than persuing the these disputes. They are there but nobody is giving it any sense of urgency. Only the western war mongers are making this a vital importance to their anti-China strategy.  They want control of this region to not only just box in China but to exploit it's resources too.</p>
		<p>Thats my interpretation of everyone on top of the information given by Bryce</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p><strong>Scott Cao:</strong></p>
		<p>Agreed with all of the above</p>
		<p>The thing I don’t understand is what the SEA gain from disputing with China?</p>
		<p>They’re just enabling the US to interfere more in Asian matters. Also, China has almost never been an expansionist country like Japan has. It just needs some breathing space since US presence literally surrounds China</p>
		<p>---</p>
		<p><strong>Brock Sun:</strong></p>
		<p>It is mostly just Vietnam. The last time China ever invaded another country was that short war in 1979 and the cost of that war on Vietnam was immense. It also damaged the Vietnamese Communist Party's legitimacy like crazy. The fact that China benefitted immensely from Reform and Opening while Vietnam was isolated and had hyperinflation (you've seen the currency now LOL) also did little to legitimize Vietnam's government. The VCP started using nationalist ideology to bind Vietnam together, instead of communist ideology. </p>
		<p>Anti-imperialism was still preached, but the US was slowly known as a distant threat that wasn't going to come back any time soon, much less present a threat to Vietnam's territory. Whereas China was seen as an immediate threat to Vietnam's territory, and a large one at that. </p>
		<p>As I said, when Vietnam ceded border land to China to build relations, the nationalists in Vietnam were having none of it. </p>
		<p>Every time the government takes what seems like an accommodating stance toward China on anything from defense to trade to investment, there are riots in the streets and the VCP gets blamed for "selling the country to China." </p>
		<p>The VCP appeases the nationalists the best way they can, and continues to indoctrinate antagonism toward China since it's an easy way of maintaining legitimacy even when economic prosperity is lacking. They deal with China in quieter ways because of this strike a delicate balance. </p>
		<p>Even if the VCP elite want to have closer ties with China and possibly even make a deal over the sea, it is difficult due to domestic considerations. However, even that is becoming less relevant since they are now empowered by the US.</p>
		<p>As for the rest of ASEAN. US involvement simply gives them more leverage in any type of dealings with China. Likewise, China's growing footprint also gives ASEAN more leverage when dealing with the US. When the US gives ASEAN a carrot, China must give bigger carrots, and so on. They're in the middle of competition. </p>
		<p>Of course, it can also be seen as a partisan issue. In the more democratic countries, aligning more closely with China or America is a preference of either political party/coalition. </p>
		<p>There will always be people playing up China threat and spewing American democratic idealism to get idiots to vote for them. </p>
		<p>I think we can relate well in America.</p>
