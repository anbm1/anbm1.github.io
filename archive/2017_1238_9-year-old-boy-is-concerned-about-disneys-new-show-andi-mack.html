		<!-- Content -->
		<p>9 year old Timothy Yang from New York wrote to ANBM sharing his concerns about Disney’s new show Andi Mack. Here’s what he had to say:</p>
		<!-- Quote -->
		<blockquote>Hi, I want to give some feedback about this new TV show. Someone showed it to me and said it was splendid because it was a fantastic Asian American centered show. I mean, it is so great to see a fantastic Asian American centered show on TV. Why? Because it is good to see Asian Americans on TV and also because I have been a child actor/model/singer for the past 3 years and I have seen and learned a lot of things in the media. One thing I am puzzled is after watching an episode of this new TV show, I did not see how it was a fantastic Asian American centered show. Great that they have some interesting story that the sisters are actually mother and daughter. And cool those girls have nice motorcycles, Not so great is that I did not see anyone like me or my father, who are Asian males, on the show. I meant they said this was an Asian American centered show so why was that half of the Asian American population was missing in the show? No Asian American son, brother, uncle, father, grand father, friends, play dates in the show? It is very strange to me. I know that females are very important because females make up half of the earth population and females do great things also. It is just like when I get auditions for playing a “Eurasian” kid’s role, we go into the casting room and see 9 other Eurasian looking kids waiting with their moms who are almost always Asians. I asked my daddy before why most kids were always with mothers. My daddy said that maybe the fathers were at work. I was like daddy you work too but you took me here. He was like well that he was lucky to make his work schedule flexible. Then I was like why couldn’t their fathers make their work schedules flexible too. He was like okay everyone’s schedule was different. So okay it was like 1 out of 10 “Eurasian” kids have Asian fathers? So I got it, but I also know a few Eurasian kids with Asian fathers so the ratio must not be 1 out of 10. It is probably more like 2 out of 10. So still that is 20% of Eurasian kids who have Asian fathers. I know I know one time this casting director asked me where I was from. I said New York. Then he said: “did you take your mother’s last name?” I said no: “what do you meant?” And he seemed a bit surprised. So anyway this new splendid Asian American centered show did not seem to have 20% Asian male representation. Why does that matter? 1. Because media is very powerful. Many of my classmates only seem to learn things from watching TV and movies. 2. The math just does not match. It should be 50% because Asian American males represent half of Asian Americans. But like the example I show, I will take 20%. But 20% does not equal 0%. So it does not make sense why someone showed me this TV show and said it was a fantastic Asian American centered show. You can not be “centered” with 0% representation of half of the population. That is my observation. See you next time.</blockquote>
